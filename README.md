Chef things for marius

Hell, I had to start learning chef at some point, so a workstation building recipie that I can try out locally seemed a relatively harmless way to do so, hence this.

Github somewhat forces me to make this public, but I guess I don't mind that, as long as it's credited properly by virtue of the GPL license.
